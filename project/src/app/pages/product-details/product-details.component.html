            <h2 class="mb-0">Anne Frank: The Biography</h2>

            <p class="justify-text">Anne Frank was born on 12 June 1929 to a lower or middle-class Jewish family in
                Frankfurt,
                Germany who feels the early threats of Nazism as Hitler rises to power in 1933. Soon her family and van
                dan
                emigrate to the Netherlands where Anne enjoys an idyllic life centred on school, socializing, boys and
                sleepovers.
                However, the situation changes quickly once Germany invades the Netherlands in May 1940. The family is
                soon forced
                to go into hiding with another family at the back building of the family business. While there Anne
                faithfully keeps
                a diary describing everyday situations and her thoughts and beliefs. After two years and one month, they
                are betrayed
                by still unknown parties and sent to concentration camps where they all perish with the exception of
                Anne's father,
                Otto Frank. The book ends with an afterword by one of the women who hid them, Otto Frank's secretary
                Miep Gies.</p>
